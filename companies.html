        <div class="para">Online recruitment is the process of using the Internet to actively
            seek out and recruit talented candidates for an organization.
            The Internet has quickly become one of the primary recruitment tools 
            for both internal recruitment and talent acquisition committees and 
            third-party talent search companies.

        <li>The primary goal of Internet recruiting is the same as traditional recruiting: to find suitable talent to employ.
    However, this emerging recruitment tool is most frequently called upon for a quick employment solution if,
    after searching the corporate database for candidates, a recruiter is unable to find suitable talent.</li>

        <li>The trickiest part of online recruiting may be deciding the best way to introduce a job offer to a candidate.
    Many individuals may be currently employed or otherwise disinterested in new job listings.</li>

        <li>Online recruitment is often a practical and efficient way to find qualified candidates to fill positions in your business. 
    This can be done by posting available positions on job boards and by reviewing candidate profiles.</li>
